# ✅ Ready to Test!

## What's Configured

Your new OAuth client is **perfectly set up**:

✅ **Type**: Web application (correct!)
✅ **Client ID**: `778654516378-r2qfdvpph3qnhe618e5dj4mju8i9ip49`
✅ **Redirect URIs**: All configured correctly
✅ **JavaScript Origins**: All configured correctly
✅ **Code Updated**: Using the new client ID

## What You Need to Do Now

### 1. Test Locally (Optional)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then go to:
- http://localhost:4200/login
- Click "Sign in with Google"
- Should redirect to Google and back

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update Google OAuth client ID"
git push
```

Vercel will auto-deploy, or deploy manually:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### 3. Test on Production

1. Go to: https://megabox-lake.vercel.app/login
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Should work! 🎉

## ✅ Everything is Ready!

- ✅ OAuth client is "Web application" type
- ✅ All redirect URIs are configured
- ✅ Code is updated with new client ID
- ✅ Ready to test!

## 🐛 If It Doesn't Work

1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** - Google changes can take time to propagate
2. **Clear browser cache** - Especially on mobile
3. **Check browser console** - Look for any error messages
4. **Verify the client ID** - Make sure it matches in Google Cloud Console

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Everything is configured correctly. Just deploy and test!
