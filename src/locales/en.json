If you use MegaBox on behalf of an organization, you confirm you have authority to bind that organization.</p></section><section><h2>2. Description of the Service</h2><p>MegaBox provides cloud storage for files and media, online streaming for supported video formats, link-based preview pages, a \"Save Before Watch\" feature, and a Promoter Program that lets creators earn from downloads or views. We may add, change, or remove features at any time.</p></section><section><h2>3.
