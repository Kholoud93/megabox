Hi Backend Team,

I've completed the frontend implementation and need your help with a few API endpoints. Here's what I need:

1. VERIFICATION NEEDED (Please confirm these exist):
   - PATCH /auth/archiveFile/:id - Frontend is using this
   - PATCH /user/updateFolderName/:id - Frontend is using this

2. ENDPOINT TO CREATE:
   - PATCH /user/archiveFolder/:id - Frontend is ready but endpoint doesn't exist in Postman

3. CLARIFICATION NEEDED:
   - GET /auth/withdrawEarnings vs POST /auth/requestWithdrawal
     What's the difference? Should we implement GET /auth/withdrawEarnings or is POST /auth/requestWithdrawal the correct one?

I've created a detailed document (BACKEND_TEAM_REQUESTS.md) with all the details, request/response formats, and frontend code locations.

Please let me know:
- Which endpoints exist/need to be created
- Timeline for creating the archive folder endpoint
- Clarification on the withdrawEarnings endpoint

Thanks!
